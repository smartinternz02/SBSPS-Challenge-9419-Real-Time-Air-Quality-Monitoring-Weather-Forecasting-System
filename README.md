Real-Time Air Quality Monitoring &amp; Weather Forecasting System
Prediction of the air quality is of at most importance. So, building a Machine Learning model that can predict 
Real Time Air Quality & that are reliable and sufficiently accurate, 
can play an important role as part of an air quality management system.
